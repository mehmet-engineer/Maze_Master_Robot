# Maze Master Arduino Robot

Mart 2020 â€“ Nisan 2020

The robot I made using Arduino microcontroller has the ability to avoid obstacles. Thanks to its movable sensor capability, it can detect which area is occupied or empty and can decide its own direction. The software I use to process the sensor data is entirely my own. It stands out with its sensitive mathematical codes against the different propagation of ultrasonic sound waves under different conditions. It is also rechargeable thanks to its powerbank body.
